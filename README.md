# ParaWave PTT - Application Push-to-Talk pour Parapentistes

A half-duplex communication application specialized for paragliding, using Apple's iOS 16+ PushToTalk framework with a Cloudflare Workers backend. A hybrid system designed to complement traditional VHF/UHF radios.

**Based on** the Vite 7 + HeroUI (v2) + Auth0 with Turborepo and Yarn 4 workspaces template.

## ParaWave PTT

ParaWave PTT is a Pushâ€‘toâ€‘Talk (PTT) halfâ€‘duplex communication system built for paragliding clubs and pilots. It combines an iOS client (native Swift app) using Apple's PushToTalk framework with a Cloudflare Workers backend for lowâ€‘latency audio chunk ingestion and session management.

This repository contains multiple workspaces:

- `ios/ParaWavePTT/ParaWavePTT` (iOS app) â€” Swift app using Apple's PushToTalk, AVFoundation and AVAudioEngine for audio capture and AAC encoding.
- `apps/cloudflare-worker` â€” Cloudflare Workers backend and Durable Objects that handle PTT sessions and audio chunk ingestion.
- `apps/backend-admin` â€” Admin web UI and API documentation for server operators.
- `docs/` â€” Design notes, API analysis and OpenAPI spec.

### Goals
- Provide a reliable, lowâ€‘latency group voice channel optimized for paragliding use cases (site channels, emergency channel, geoâ€‘local channels).
- Use AACâ€‘LC for energyâ€‘efficient hardware accelerated encoding on iOS.
- Integrate Apple PushToTalk framework for best UX on iOS 16+ devices.
- Support serverâ€‘side session management, push token handling and realâ€‘time distribution via WebSockets/Durable Objects.

### Features
- iOS client with PushToTalk integration (channel join/leave, transmit/stop, ephemeral PTT push tokens).
- Audio capture with AVAudioEngine and conversion to AACâ€‘LC before upload.
- Chunked audio upload endpoint for streaming audio to the backend.
- Cloudflare Workers backend with API endpoints for transmission lifecycle (start, chunk, end) and optional WebSocket/Durable Object relay.
- Admin UI for channel management and telemetry.

### Quick project structure
- `ios/ParaWavePTT/ParaWavePTT` â€” Main iOS app project
- `apps/cloudflare-worker` â€” Worker code, tests and migrations
- `apps/backend-admin` â€” Admin web app and OpenAPI client
- `docs/openapi.json` â€” API specification used by the apps

### Development notes â€” iOS
- Target iOS 16.0 or later. PushToTalk framework is only available on real devices.
- Make sure the app has the following entitlements and capabilities:
   - Pushâ€‘toâ€‘Talk capability (`com.apple.developer.push-to-talk`)
   - App Group configured if you share data between extensions
   - Background audio modes including `push-to-talk` in `UIBackgroundModes`
   - Remote notifications (for PTT push flow)
- Microphone permission required (`AVAudioSession` `requestRecordPermission`).
- Audio capture: app uses `AVAudioEngine` input node and installs a tap to obtain `AVAudioPCMBuffer`. The buffer is encoded to AACâ€‘LC before being base64 encoded and sent to the backend chunk endpoint.

### Backend notes
- The backend accepts chunked audio via `POST /api/v1/transmissions/{session_id}/chunk` and expects base64â€‘encoded payloads.
- AudioFormat supported: `aac-lc`, `opus`, `pcm`. The iOS client should send `aac-lc` by default.
- Durable Objects / WebSocket relay used for delivering realâ€‘time audio to channel participants when available.

### How to build & run (high level)

#### iOS client
- Open `ios/ParaWavePTT/ParaWavePTT.xcodeproj` in Xcode 14+.
- Select a physical device (PushToTalk is not supported in Simulator).
- Ensure provisioning profile includes PushToTalk capability and App Group if configured.
- Build & run.

#### Cloudflare Worker (local dev)
- Install Node 18+ and Wrangler (per Cloudflare docs).
- From repo root:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev:env
```

### Admin web UI
- Located at `apps/backend-admin`. Uses Vite. See that app's README for dev commands.

### API and tests
- The repository includes an OpenAPI description in `docs/openapi.json` used by the admin UI and backend tests.
- Unit and integration tests for the Cloudflare Worker are in `apps/cloudflare-worker/test`.

## Notes & Caveats
- AAC encoding on iOS should use `AVAudioConverter`/`AudioToolbox` to produce AACâ€‘LC frames. Be careful to produce proper ADTS/ADIF headers if the backend expects raw AAC frames or packaged containers. The current implementation encodes to MPEGâ€‘4 AAC frames and the backend expects base64 of that stream.
- For production, tune audio bitrate and packet sizing for network conditions (e.g., 24â€“64 kbps typical for voice).
- Always test endâ€‘toâ€‘end on physical devices across network conditions.

To use the authentication system in your application, wrap your components with the `AuthenticationProvider`:

### Auth0 Configuration

To use Auth0, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Auth0 Account:**
   - Go to [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and sign up for a free account.

2. **Create a New Application:**
   - In the Auth0 dashboard, navigate to the "Applications" section.
   - Click on "Create Application".
   - Choose a name for your application.
   - Select "Single Page Web Applications" as the application type.
   - Click "Create".

3. **Configure Application Settings:**
   - In the application settings, you will find your `Client ID` and `Domain`.
   - Set the "Allowed Callback URLs" to `http://localhost:5173` (or your development URL).
   - Set the "Allowed Logout URLs" to `http://localhost:5173` (or your development URL).
   - Set the "Allowed Web Origins" to `http://localhost:5173` (or your development URL).

4. **Sample settings:**
   - The settings used by the demo deployment on GitHub Pages are:
     - Allowed Callback URLs: `https://sctg-development.github.io/vite-react-heroui-auth0-template`
     - Allowed Logout URLs: `https://sctg-development.github.io/vite-react-heroui-auth0-template`
     - Allowed Web Origins: `https://sctg-development.github.io`
     - On Github repository settings, the `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` secret is set to the Auth0 client ID and the `AUTH0_DOMAIN` secret is set to the Auth0 domain.
     - The full Auth0 configuration screenshot is available [here](https://sctg-development.github.io/vite-react-heroui-auth0-template/auth0-settings.pdf).

5. **Configure API in Auth0:**
   - Navigate to "APIs" section in the Auth0 dashboard
   - Click "Create API"
   - Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "My Application API")
